# archfiles
Hello. This is my first Arch rice. Most of the configs are taken from default and modified upon little by little, with the exception of [wofi](https://github.com/prtce/wofi) and [waybar](https://github.com/sameemul-haque/dotfiles). Therefore the functions available are very bare minimum, with some missing that I may add in later on

# Dependencies
- **DE:** [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)
- **Top Bar:** [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
- **Terminal:** [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- **Notification Center:** [swaync](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter)
- **Application Launcher:** [wofi](https://sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/)

# Installation
Move each config file to respective directories under `~/.config/` e.g. waybar config in  `~/.config/waybar/`. May refer to each documentation for more specific instructions.
