# archfiles
Hello. This is my first Arch rice. Most of the configs are taken from default and modified upon little by little, with the exception of [wofi](https://github.com/prtce/wofi)/[rofi](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) and [waybar](https://github.com/sameemul-haque/dotfiles). Therefore the functions available are very bare minimum, with some missing that I may add in later on

Note: rofi is not included in the repo because i took it 1:1 from the original
